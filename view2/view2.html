                <p>I was lucky enough to work with a team of brilliant scientists on this project. After a simple cheek-swab test, our algorithm created a thoroughly personalized nutrition plan based on the particular way one's DNA creates and regulates proteins. In other words, it recommended foods in an <em>'achieve x by eating y'</em> format. </p>
                <p>For example, bison happens to make my body produce muscle quicker than other protein.</p>
                <p>As lead designer for the company, my goals were to deliver a hopeful, supportive interface through which users  interacted with the information that may help them to achieve better well-being. </p>

                <p>The first alpha-iteration of the product listed the top 5 foods in each of seven food groups and focused on the architecture of traceback data delivered by the backend.</p>
                <p>Each recommendation expanded to reveal the genetics behind each decision. I quickly designed a layout that kept the list skimmable, but allowed for more granular study.</p>

            <p>I had a lot of fun creating the DNA-test kit/DNA Analysis checkout process. All users followed a series of steps that split into different buckets depending on the particular order; every step dynamically added the next fields onto the form, which kept information in context and felt comfortable.</p>

              <p>Iteration #2 arrived after a thoughtful look at how people interacted with our first prototype — after conversations with advisors, thought leaders, chocolatiers, kickstarters, and one another. Julian Weisser and I excitedly scribbled down on my whiteboard ideas for the lively upgrade of our previous nutritional dashboard.</p>
