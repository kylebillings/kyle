              <h3>Project Scope</h3>
              <p>For Ekko.fm, I was brought on to add branding elements, interactions, and onboarding content to an existing web application. Music and photo uploads were already set up, and I organized the assets into a more modern, intuitive layout.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <h3>Landing Page</h3>
              <img src="images/ekko1.png" alt="ekko" class="img-responsive">
              <p>Starting with the landing page, I located imagery that suggested both photography and music, the two main content types for the site. This would become the account creation screen after the login wall was removed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Before</h3>
                <img src="images/ekko2.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">

              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>After</h3>
                <img src="images/ekko3.png" alt="" class="img-responsive">
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>After creating an account, the application delivered users to their new (empty) feed. To clear up confusion, I added a conditional that presented a bit of onboarding copy to first timers with empty feeds.
                I also consolidated navigation, gave more real estate to the <em>discover</em> tab, and filed activity, upload, and profile into a single <em>My Ekko</em> page.</p>
