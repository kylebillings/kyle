        <p><strong>Product Designer; <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> | October 2016 – Present </strong><br><em>Codecademy is an interactive online education platform that offers programming lessons to over 25 million learners worldwide. I combine the research methods and creative confidence of a product designer with metrics-driven marketing objectives to discover opportunities for authentic, product-driven growth.</em></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Developed the marketing funnel and in-product experience for the launch of Codecademy Intensives&#8202;—&#8202;grew enrollments from $0 to $165,000 per month.</li>
          <li>Designed an on-platform upgrade experience as a sustainable alternative to email marketing&#8202;—&#8202;increased repeatable Intensives revenue to 25% of total.</li>
          <li>Provided creative direction, messaging guidelines, and assets to help marketing capture millions of dollars in revenue while remaining aligned with product.</li>
          <li>Managed the growth team and produced a roadmap of projects dedicated to hitting Codecademy's aggressive quarterly revenue targets.</li>
          <!-- <li>sep</li>
          <li>Codecademy had developed a new paid offering (Codecademy Pro Intensives) and hadn’t established a funnel for enrollments. I compiled buyer profiles, designed the payments experience, A/B tested marketing pages, launched email campaigns, and built a dashboard to monitor performance. Iterating on this funnel grew Intensives from $0 to over $165,000 per month in enrollments.</li>
          <li>Codecademy had nearly exhausted its email list and needed a sustainable source of enrollments to its Intensive programs. I combined personas with user session recordings to highlight learner needs and designed a new first time user experience that surfaced Intensive programs to likely buyers alongside helpful industry context. The new experience grew to reliably contribute over 25% of enrollments.</li>
          <li>I developed a system of guidelines and templates for visuals and copy that helped Codecademy invest in a dedicated marketing team. I provided ongoing creative direction for newsletters, course launches, partnerships, paid ads, and video productions. My foundational work has helped the now 6-person marketing team generate millions of dollars in revenue. </li>
          <li>I managed a dedicated growth team to help pursue Codecademy’s quarterly targets. I studied existing metrics, diagramed conversion rates across the site to identify high-impact opportunities for growth, and produced a roadmap of growth projects. </li> -->
